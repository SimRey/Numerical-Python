#                                           Tsiolkovsky Rocket Optimization
# The Tsiolkovsky rocket has a direct correlation between the change of velocity  (Î”v) of a rocket, wet mass (m0),
# dry mass (mf), and exhaust velocity (v0).
# This problem optimizes the design of a simple rocket for profit. Potential revenue increases with greater change in
# velocity, as greater velocities allow the payload to reach higher orbits that have less drag, allowing it to remain
# in orbit longer. Wet mass, dry mass, and exhaust velocity are design variables, where wet mass is the total initial
# mass of the rocket, including propellant, and dry mass is the mass of the rocket at full ascent.

# The rocket must have a dry mass of at least 20,000 kilograms and the change in velocity should be between 9,400 m/s
# and 20,200 meters per second. Varying designs allow for exhaust velocities ranging from 2,500 m/s to 4,500 m/s.
# An appropriate guess value for the wet mass is 150,650 kilograms.
